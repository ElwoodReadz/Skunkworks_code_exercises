# Skunkworks-code-exercises
This repo contains a number of programming exercises of various difficulty levels. The following exercises exist here:

#robotInventory
Coding practice with arrays, loops, conditionals, and strings. Students will work on the basics of C++ while making a program to track what parts are present on a robot.

Difficulty: Low

#linkedList
Coding and design practice with classes and pointers. Students will learn about dealing with references and designing object-oriented code as they solve a canonical programming problem. This exercise also serves as an introduction to dynamic data structures.

Difficulty: Low

#ghost
A competitive introduction to AI and polymorphism. Students will learn about file I/O, designing data structures for performance, and interfaces while creating bots to play a word game.

Difficulty: Medium

#PIDDebug
Debugging practice using simulated PID controllers, encoders, and motors. Students will solve a variety of common compile errors, runtime crashes and logic mistakes while fixing the supplied broken program. Students will be taught about basic debugger features to help with this project. The fully-working program is a useful tool for learning about and examining the functionality of PID controllers.

Difficulty: High
