RoboSim
  -simulator for a drivebase similar to PIDDebug
  -write simulation code by making wrappers for WPILib classes and writing mocked versions
  -given gear reductions and dimensions of the wheelbase and wheels, simulate sensor feedback from encoders and absolute gyro
  -extension: localize robot using simulated sensor feedback
  -focused on WPILib, simulation, and inheritance
  -prerequisites are control flow, classes, and pointers
  -high difficulty

Sudoku
  -design a sudoku class with a read/writable grid
  -include getters, setters, and a formatted print method
  -use nested arrays
  -extension: make a solver class that can take a sudoku object, attempt to solve it, and print its results
  -focused on classes and nested arrays
  -prerequisites are control flow, arrays, variables, and pointers
  -medium difficulty

VendingMachine
  -simple program that simulates a vending machine
  -learn about state machines and implement code based on a state transition diagram
  -present users with a menu that allows them to insert money or press a button for a drink or a snack
  -keep track of current money balance and don't give users free food
  -return change at end of transaction
  -extension: limit inventory of goods and add a restock action
  -focused on control flow and variables
  -no prerequisites
  -low difficulty
