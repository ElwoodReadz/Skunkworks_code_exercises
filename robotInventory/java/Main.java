// You'll write your solution to the task in this file. This text is called a comment; comments do nothing when the program
// compiled or run, but let programmers embed explanations of their code in the source code files themselves. Comments
// are either text after two forward slashes until the end of a line ("//", like on this line), or text between a forward
// slash followed by an asterisk ("/*") and an asterisk followed by a forward slash ("*/"). The first few lines of code
// in this file are boilerplate which you don't necessarily need to understand yet. You may read the comments that explain
// each line, or you may skip to the one that reads "Your code here" if you just want to know where to start writing.

/*
* Java is based around classes, which are descriptions of certain specific types of objects. They can be made up of state
* information (which is stored in variables called "members") and behaviors (as functions called "methods"). Each .java
* source code file must contain the definition of a class that matches the file's name. In this case, this file is called
* "Main.java" and we are declaring and defining a class called "Main" below.

    * Below is a method called "main()" (note the lower-case M and parentheses). Methods are sequences of code which can
    * be executed by "calling" them. The main() method is special because it's the method that the Java Virtual Machine
    * (the program that executes Java code) calls to start your program, called the "entry point." It is static, meaning
    * that it can be called without an instance of the Main class existing, and it takes an array of Strings called "argv"
    * as a parameter. If you were to run your code from a terminal, argv would contain any of the arguments that you
    * included in your command.
